T-PRISM
================================

PRISM is a declarative probabilistic logic programming language which can perform ecient probability calculation
by probabilistic propositional calculation based on distribution semantics. On the other hand, deep learning
frameworks such as Tensorflow attracts attention in recent years with the development of deep learning techniques.
Also, by using these frameworks, it is easy to calculate multidimensional array (tensor) including high-speed
matrix calculation using GPGPU. That is why that introducing calculation using Tensorflow and deep learning
techniques to PRISM is expected to improve the current PRISM system.
