# PRISM: PRogramming In Statistical Modeling
PRISM is a general programming language intended for symbolic-statistical modeling. It is a new and unprecedented programming language with learning ability for statistical parameters embedded in programs.
Its programming system is a powerful tool for building complex statistical models.

## Installation

#### 1. Download pre-build package from [release page](https://github.com/prismplp/prism/releases):

If you want to install the latest development version package pre-built with the latest version of ubuntu (the latest version from github is automatically built), 
you can install it with the following command.
```
wget "https://github.com/prismplp/prism/releases/download/v2.4.2a(T-PRISM)-prerelease/prism_linux_dev.auto.tar.gz"

```

#### 2. Extract binaries and sample programs.

If you downloaded a different release version, please change the file name and unzip it in the same way.
```
tar xvf prism_linux_dev.auto.tar.gz
```


#### 3. Setting the proper environmental variable: 
```
export PATH=<current directory>/prism/bin:${PATH}
```

#### 4. Try!
```
$ prism
```
Press Ctrl+D to quit the interactive mode.

# T-PRISM: Tensorized-PRISM  (Pre-release)
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1901.08548-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08548)

T-PRISM is a new logic programming language based on tensor embeddings.
Our embedding scheme, named tensorized semantics, is a modification of the distribution semantics in PRISM, one of the state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming languages, by replacing distribution functions with multidimensional arrays.
